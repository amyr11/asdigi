## Description

A visual schedule is an image-based tool that helps support autistic children. It presents a sequence of events for what is going to happen during a specific task, during an activity, or throughout the day.

Visual schedules (also known as visual timetables) provide visual information (real objects, photographs, pictures or words) about planned events. Visual schedules can provide information about:

- what is happening 'first and next'
- the steps in an activity
- the tasks to complete in a session
- the timetable of a whole day
- a weekly timetable or longer

Visual schedules can help to reduce anxiety and confusion and to increase independence.

Many autistic children prefer to stick to regular routines. And unexpected scheduling changes can be upsetting and stressful. Even transitioning between regular activities can be difficult if a child does not know what to expect.

A visual schedule can help autistic children understand what‚Äôs coming next, which can help facilitate smoother transitions.

Also, the visual schedule can reinforce lessons or help develop new skills. Giving a child a visual schedule allows them to study, learn, and repeat the expected behaviors of a task or activity.

## Example

To help the child prepare for school. The schedule could include photographs depicting tasks that need to be done, such as:

- brushing your teeth
- getting dressed
- combing your hair
- eating breakfast
- packing your backpack
- getting on the school bus

Once the child is at school, they may have another visual schedule to follow. That schedule could include things like:

- saying hello to your teacher
- sitting at your desk
- working on your reading
- going outside for recess
- eating lunch in the cafeteria
- going to art class
- getting on the bus

## ****How to make a visual schedule****

The process of making a visual schedule will be different for each child, each family, and likely for each goal. 

### **Prior to developing visual schedules**

1. Identify the target skill or routine
    - For example, if you want to make the morning routine easier, focus on that for a visual schedule first. Break down the activities of the morning into simple, achievable steps.
2. Find the right visual style
    - Choose the type of symbol to use (words, pictures, photos or a combination). The best visual tool should be based on what the child understands.
    - Work with a speech pathologist if needed.
    - Some children may respond better to seeing pictures of themselves doing the task. Others may prefer illustrations. And others may only need a text list.
    - Most of the time photos are easier to understand than pictures, e.g. a photo of the assembly hall will be more recognizable than a generic picture of a school hall.
3. Decide how much information to present
    - Use your knowledge of the student‚Äôs attention and comprehension to decide how much information to present. This could be a single step e.g. a first ‚Äì next visual), a session (3 ‚Äì 4 tasks) or a whole day.

### Steps in creating visual schedules include:

1. Identify time/s of the day when visuals are needed. This could include transitions and other times of the day or week that are stressful for your students.
2. Decide what you want to communicate to the students e.g. the two steps in a transition or a visual list of activities to help promote independence in a work session.
3. You should design the visual so that you (and the student) can see when items have finished. This could involve ticking them off or removing the pictures and putting them in a finished box.
4. Write down what you want to put in the visual support
5. Source photos, pictures or other materials from your own photos, online photo or picture sites or by hand drawing the pictures. You might need to take photos of specific tasks or places (e.g. a photo of the hall to show assembly time).
6. Create the visual support. It is often best to create a blank schedule that you can put pictures on and take them off as needed. Pictures or photos can be printed separately and stuck to the schedule using blu-tack, Velcro or similar. Some teachers find it helpful to laminate visual schedules and pictures to make them more durable.
7. Show the visual schedule to the student. Show them what the pictures represent. Teach them how to remove a picture when it is finished (or tick it off).
8. Place the visual where the student can see it easily. This could be on the white board, the student‚Äôs desk or on a wall. Make sure the visual schedule is accessible to the student/s who need it.
9. Use the visual schedule before and during the activities. It may be necessary to use a portable visual to take to different locations (e.g. a small visual that can be taken to the hall showing ‚ÄòFirst assembly, next sport‚Äô).
10. Use simple language to accompany the pictures e.g. ‚Äòassembly is finished, time for sport‚Äô.

`üí° Learning to use visual schedules is a process and it may take some time for students to understand the purpose and benefit from them. Prompts and cues will be necessary at first, these should be gradually faded as the student learns to use the schedule.

### **Types of visual schedules**

Visual schedules can be created to represent any period of time. This can include:

**First ‚Äì next reminders**¬†(e.g. "first worksheet, next computers")

**Daily schedules**, showing the main activities across a day. These can include more detail if needed or can simply highlight the important events in a day.

**Weekly schedules**, which show the main elements of a student‚Äôs weekly activities.

### **Teaching your autistic child to use a visual schedule**

First things first: You have to establish a baseline of exceptions with a child. In other words, they first need to understand what sequenced activities are and how they will work. They cannot just jump into a five-activity schedule and be expected to succeed.

Start by teaching them the ‚Äúfirst, then‚Äù concept. They should understand that they need to accomplish the first task on a list,¬†*then*¬†they can move to the second task.

Once that behavior is established, you can move on to a more detailed visual schedule.

If your child struggles with specific tasks, break those down into even smaller steps.

In all cases, provide your child with positive reinforcement and good feedback on their successes with a visual schedule. These reinforcements can be more time for preferred activities in their schedule, praise, or even treats.

## Age Group

| Preschool | Yes ‚Äì using predominantly photos/simple pictures including simple ‚ÄòFirst ‚Äì then‚Äô schedules |
| --- | --- |
| P-2 | Yes ‚Äì using predominantly photos/simple pictures including simple ‚ÄòFirst ‚Äì then‚Äô schedules. Words included. Session, daily and weekly schedules appropriate |
| 3-6 | Yes ‚Äì many students will cope with more abstract pictures and more written words. Session, daily and weekly schedules appropriate. |
| High school | Yes ‚Äì consider the use of abstract pictures and more words, depending on the student‚Äôs needs |

# Cause

Meltdowns are different from regular tantrums because they are **caused by a sensory overload in the brain**, rather than just being a reaction to not getting what you want. They can involve intense emotions and physical movements like screaming or crying, and they cannot be controlled. Once someone has a meltdown, they need time to calm down before they can respond to typical calming techniques.

## **Nervous system overload and sensory processing**

When children have difficulties processing sensory information, it can cause their nervous system to become overwhelmed. Sensory inputs are the way we interact with the world around us, through things like touch, smell, sound, and sight. But when a child's nervous system is impaired, they can experience and react to sensory inputs differently.

When sensory inputs become too intense or dysregulated, it can trigger a response in the lower part of the brain that is responsible for our basic survival instincts. This can make the child feel like they are in danger and can cause them to react with behaviors like fighting, running away, or freezing up. At this point, it becomes hard for the child to think clearly or understand what's happening around them.

Specifically,

- Autistic meltdowns can happen at any age, not just in young children on the spectrum.
- Meltdowns often begin with warning signals, such as verbal pleas or physical signs of distress.
- Meltdowns may involve self-stimulatory behaviors such as rocking or pacing to help regulate anxiety or sensory input.
- Unlike typical tantrums, autistic meltdowns are not manipulative and serve no purpose other than expressing genuine distress.

# What to do

## **Avoiding meltdowns**

1. Identify difficult situation
    1. Help your child recognize situations that may be difficult for them and lead to meltdowns. You can create a list with your child of situations that they find challenging, such as changes in routine, loud noises, or crowded places. Keep track of these situations in a diary to see if there are any patterns or triggers for meltdowns.
2. Notice Early warning signs
    1. Help your child to notice when they're starting to feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed. You can do this by practicing recognizing emotions like anxiety or describing physical sensations like a racing heart or upset stomach before a meltdown happens.
3. Develop coping Strategies
    1. This is about your child knowing what helps them feel comfortable and calm in difficult situations. Options for coping in difficult situations might include:
        - [breathing exercises](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/wellbeing/breathing-exercises-relaxation-activity),¬†[muscle relaxation techniques](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/wellbeing/muscle-relaxation-activity-children-parents)¬†or simple things like taking a break and listening to music
        - practical actions like leaving classes a few minutes early to avoid noisy, crowded corridors
        - sensory aids like headphones to deal with triggering noises or favourite fragrances to deal with triggering smells.
4. Practice coping Strategies
    1. Encourage your child to practise their coping strategies when they‚Äôre feeling calm. This will make it easier for your child to remember and use the strategies when they‚Äôre feel stressed or overwhelmed.
    2. For example, you could make daily breathing exercises part of your child‚Äôs routine, or your child could practice using headphones when it gets noisy at home. Or you and your child could talk to their teachers about your child regularly leaving class 5 minutes early.

## **Leading up to a meltdown**

If your child is feeling overwhelmed or agitated, you can help them manage their emotions and calm down by doing the following:

- Look for signs that your child is getting frustrated, angry, or anxious, such as screeching, running away, putting hands over ears, rocking, pacing, or withdrawing.
- Change the environment to make your child feel more comfortable, like closing a door, turning down music, or moving to a quieter space.
- Give your child 2-3 choices to redirect them towards something positive, like choosing a different activity, going for a walk, or using a sensory toy.
- Remind your child to use relaxation techniques, sensory aids, or other options.
- Use pictures or written words to guide your child to a safe, quiet place and suggest calming strategies.
- Give your child space and don't touch them.
- Stay calm yourself and offer to do a breathing exercise with your child.

## **During a meltdown**

Sometimes you can‚Äôt avoid a meltdown. When a meltdown happens, these steps can help:

1. Guide your child to a safe place, if possible.
2. Give your child space, don‚Äôt touch them, and keep other people away.
3. Turn down lights and keep things quiet, or give your child noise-cancelling headphones.
4. Let one person speak to your child, but don‚Äôt say too much.
5. Stay calm and wait.

## **After a meltdown**

Here are some simple steps to follow after your child has a meltdown:

1. Give your child some time and space to calm down and recover.
2. Encourage your child to engage in a calming and familiar activity, such as reading a book, playing with a pet, or listening to music.
3. Later, when you and your child are both feeling calm, you can talk about what happened during the meltdown, if your child is able to communicate about it.
4. Try to identify any new triggers or combinations of triggers that caused the meltdown, so that you can create a plan to avoid similar situations in the future.

# Getting professional support

If your child often has meltdowns and you‚Äôre struggling to manage them, a good first step is talking with your child‚Äôs¬†[GP](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/general-practitioner),¬†[pediatrician](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/paediatrician),¬†[psychologist](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/psychologist)¬†or other health professionals. They can suggest¬†[therapies and supports](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/therapies-guide)¬†that can help your child build skills to manage emotions. They can also help you support your child‚Äôs emotional development.
