# Cause

Meltdowns are different from regular tantrums because they are **caused by a sensory overload in the brain**, rather than just being a reaction to not getting what you want. They can involve intense emotions and physical movements like screaming or crying, and they cannot be controlled. Once someone has a meltdown, they need time to calm down before they can respond to typical calming techniques.

## **Nervous system overload and sensory processing**

When children have difficulties processing sensory information, it can cause their nervous system to become overwhelmed. Sensory inputs are the way we interact with the world around us, through things like touch, smell, sound, and sight. But when a child's nervous system is impaired, they can experience and react to sensory inputs differently.

When sensory inputs become too intense or dysregulated, it can trigger a response in the lower part of the brain that is responsible for our basic survival instincts. This can make the child feel like they are in danger and can cause them to react with behaviors like fighting, running away, or freezing up. At this point, it becomes hard for the child to think clearly or understand what's happening around them.

Specifically,

- Autistic meltdowns can happen at any age, not just in young children on the spectrum.
- Meltdowns often begin with warning signals, such as verbal pleas or physical signs of distress.
- Meltdowns may involve self-stimulatory behaviors such as rocking or pacing to help regulate anxiety or sensory input.
- Unlike typical tantrums, autistic meltdowns are not manipulative and serve no purpose other than expressing genuine distress.

# What to do

## **Avoiding meltdowns**

1. Identify difficult situation
    1. Help your child recognize situations that may be difficult for them and lead to meltdowns. You can create a list with your child of situations that they find challenging, such as changes in routine, loud noises, or crowded places. Keep track of these situations in a diary to see if there are any patterns or triggers for meltdowns.
2. Notice Early warning signs
    1. Help your child to notice when they're starting to feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed. You can do this by practicing recognizing emotions like anxiety or describing physical sensations like a racing heart or upset stomach before a meltdown happens.
3. Develop coping Strategies
    1. This is about your child knowing what helps them feel comfortable and calm in difficult situations. Options for coping in difficult situations might include:
        - [breathing exercises](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/wellbeing/breathing-exercises-relaxation-activity), [muscle relaxation techniques](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/wellbeing/muscle-relaxation-activity-children-parents) or simple things like taking a break and listening to music
        - practical actions like leaving classes a few minutes early to avoid noisy, crowded corridors
        - sensory aids like headphones to deal with triggering noises or favourite fragrances to deal with triggering smells.
4. Practice coping Strategies
    1. Encourage your child to practise their coping strategies when they’re feeling calm. This will make it easier for your child to remember and use the strategies when they’re feel stressed or overwhelmed.
    2. For example, you could make daily breathing exercises part of your child’s routine, or your child could practice using headphones when it gets noisy at home. Or you and your child could talk to their teachers about your child regularly leaving class 5 minutes early.

## **Leading up to a meltdown**

If your child is feeling overwhelmed or agitated, you can help them manage their emotions and calm down by doing the following:

- Look for signs that your child is getting frustrated, angry, or anxious, such as screeching, running away, putting hands over ears, rocking, pacing, or withdrawing.
- Change the environment to make your child feel more comfortable, like closing a door, turning down music, or moving to a quieter space.
- Give your child 2-3 choices to redirect them towards something positive, like choosing a different activity, going for a walk, or using a sensory toy.
- Remind your child to use relaxation techniques, sensory aids, or other options.
- Use pictures or written words to guide your child to a safe, quiet place and suggest calming strategies.
- Give your child space and don't touch them.
- Stay calm yourself and offer to do a breathing exercise with your child.

## **During a meltdown**

Sometimes you can’t avoid a meltdown. When a meltdown happens, these steps can help:

1. Guide your child to a safe place, if possible.
2. Give your child space, don’t touch them, and keep other people away.
3. Turn down lights and keep things quiet, or give your child noise-cancelling headphones.
4. Let one person speak to your child, but don’t say too much.
5. Stay calm and wait.

## **After a meltdown**

Here are some simple steps to follow after your child has a meltdown:

1. Give your child some time and space to calm down and recover.
2. Encourage your child to engage in a calming and familiar activity, such as reading a book, playing with a pet, or listening to music.
3. Later, when you and your child are both feeling calm, you can talk about what happened during the meltdown, if your child is able to communicate about it.
4. Try to identify any new triggers or combinations of triggers that caused the meltdown, so that you can create a plan to avoid similar situations in the future.

# Getting professional support

If your child often has meltdowns and you’re struggling to manage them, a good first step is talking with your child’s [GP](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/general-practitioner), [pediatrician](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/paediatrician), [psychologist](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/psychologist) or other health professionals. They can suggest [therapies and supports](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/therapies-guide) that can help your child build skills to manage emotions. They can also help you support your child’s emotional development.
